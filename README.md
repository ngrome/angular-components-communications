# AngularComponentsComminication

This is the repo for the DEMO application @Angular Rome Meetup on 5th November 2018 about how to think and structure an Angular Application.

For running the demo you need an API KEY on Eventbrite. You can get it for free and use inside a file called `api.ts` inside `environments` folder. Of course, this file is not in the repository, so you can look at the `api.template.ts`.

The master branch is an empty basic structure, with empty file.
You can check the others branch, the Meetup branch is a basic structure without any logic communication, then you have two branch with and without NgRx.

The demo is very very basic and it's scope is only for tutorial purpose and not for production.

Feel free to ask and give advice.
